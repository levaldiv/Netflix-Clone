# Responsive Netflix Clone Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Responsive Netflix Clone Challenge! I was tasked to create a semi-clone of the Netflix app with a responsive design (works on lg, md, sm devices). This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on TypeScript, API, Firebase.

**NOTE:**
