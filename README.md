# Responsive Netflix Clone Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Responsive Netflix Clone Challenge! I was tasked to create a semi-clone of the Netflix app with a responsive design (works on lg, md, sm devices). This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on TypeScript, API, Firebase.

**NOTE:** This uses test data, so no credit info is needed as it is provided with Stripe.
<br/>
**NOTE:** Demo and deployed site will be added soon (fixing some minor issues at the moment)


## How to use

- Since this is a Clone, provide an email + password and click on SIGN UP NOW
- It will take you to a plan portal
- There you can select what plan you want
- Click on subscribe and it will take you to Stripes payment portal
- Since I am using Stripe's test data, navigate to [Testing](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to stimulate payments usig their credit card information
- Once you have filled the required info, click on Subscribe
- Congragulations, you have logged in to the app
- You can click on any movie and their respective trailer will play (NOTE: the audio will play as soon as you click on a movie)
- To Logout, click on the logo on the top left
